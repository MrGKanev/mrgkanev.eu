I'm sure you have heard it before. Stop your mobile notifications. They are eating your time ... bla ... bla ... bla...

Yes, that is correct, they are eating time, but don't stop them completely. Limit them. Self-discipline is the key. Whenever I hear someone telling me they have stopped their notifications I ask what about X or Y types of apps and they don't have an answer.
Apps such as:

* bank apps - sending you notifications about your balance or accepting a payment
* Calendar - sending you notifications about your events
* 2nd verifications -  you need to login into websites/apps sometimes.
* Delivery apps - Do you want your pizza to be delivered to you?

Thinks you need to think about when enabling/disabling notifications:

* Messaging apps - I only have 8 social media on my phone. (Wait isn't that too much?) They are all limited to 5-15 mins a day, so If I need something I can use it, but only for important tasks. Only my main communication app is allowed to send me notifications. - I use FB Messanger.
* Limiting people on messaging apps - I only have max 10 people that can send me notifications.  - Everyone else can wait.
* Games - you can limit 90% of the notifications you receive and not be a "noob" about it

P.S. - I don't want to be a jackass to no one about it, I want to be a better person. I don't want to be a slave to my phone.

A little tutorial on how to disable notifications sounds in Messanger on Android. - "It works on all apps which lag a lot"

1. Create a custom file that is empty - as my head on Monday morning - [or download my creation](https://mrgkanev.eu/download/no-notifications.wav)
2. Put it in the "Notifications" folder which is on your device's ROM storage.
* You can copy it using an application that can work with your filesystem such as ["Files by Google"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files) or ["Total Commander - file manager"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghisler.android.TotalCommander). There are many more but I have used these for the past few years and they are great.
3. You need to select the file in Messenger. To do this, go to its settings > Notifications & Sounds > Notification Sound.
