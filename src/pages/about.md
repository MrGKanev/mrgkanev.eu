Hi everyone,

I’m a self-employed web developer, geek, and open-source enthusiast. Currently living in the small town of Ruse which is in Bulgaria. (Europe) Building things that make businesses more productive and happier is something that I do in my spare time.

Still, a university student fighting for my master’s degree in Computer Engineering, helping colleagues and teachers on my way.

I have been working in the IT industry for over 10 years. From day one, I’ve always been passionate about IT, software development, IT security, the open web, and open-source software. I write about knowledge management, software development, entrepreneurship, bootstrap, management, leadership, and more.
