No-code apps have become popular in recent years as a way for businesses to create apps and software solutions without needing to write code. While no-code platforms can be useful tools for prototyping and testing ideas, relying on them for long-term business solutions may not be the best idea. In this article, we'll explore why no-code apps may not be a good fit for your business in the long term.

### Pricing

Bubble announced new pricing plans on Thursday, which makes hhundreds of "no code" developers flagged usage peaks. That results in over 10 times higher system costs due to the recent change. This will impact a lot of SaaS because No-code apps don't have an easy infrastructure to "maintain". Nobody knows if it can "be done better" and what is better for platforms like that.

### Limited Customization

Platforms like this are designed to be easy to use, but they also limited customization. While you can use pre-built templates and modules to create your app, if you need a feature that isn't offered, you may be out of luck. Customization requires coding, which defeats the purpose of a no-code platform. As your business grows and evolves, you may find that you need more flexibility and control over your software solutions.

### Scalability

No-code applications may not be able to handle the growth and scale of your business. They may not be able to accommodate the increased traffic, user data, and complexity that come with growth. This means that you may need to switch to a more robust platform or build a custom solution, which can be expensive and time-consuming. It's important to consider scalability when choosing a platform, as you don't want to be held back by a lack of features or functionality.

### Security

They often rely on third-party plugins and integrations, which can introduce security vulnerabilities. If your app handles sensitive data, such as personal information or financial transactions, you need to ensure that your app is secure and compliant with data privacy regulations. This means that you may need to invest in additional security measures or use a different platform altogether. Security is a critical concern for any business, and it's important to take it seriously when developing software solutions.

### Dependency

When you use a no-code platform, you're dependent on the platform provider. If the provider goes out of business, your app may no longer be supported, and you may lose access to your data. You may also be subject to the provider's pricing and feature changes, which can affect your business operations. This means that you may need to plan for contingencies and have a backup plan in case your no-code platform is no longer viable.

In conclusion, no-code apps are not suitable for long-term business solutions. To ensure scalability, customization, security, and independence, you may need to consider building a custom solution or using a more robust platform such as most of the CMS's out there (WordPress, Joomla and etc), most public frameworks (Laravel, Ruby on Rails and etc). While no-code apps may be tempting due to their ease of use and low cost, it's important to consider the long-term implications of your software solutions. By planning ahead and choosing the right platform, you can ensure that your business is able to grow and thrive over the long term.
